KnightLife is an iOS mobile app developed using React Native and Supabase. The app was made with UCF Students and Faculty members in mind, right down to the color palette, which was chosen to match that of the University.

The app's goal is to make getting involved on campus easier. Inviting university clubs and organizations onto the platform as "creators," it pools all events into one reliable place for students and faculty to discover and query.

The app has been thoroughly tested by our target users and our design has been tailored to ensure a positive user experience.
